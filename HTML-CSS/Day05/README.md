<h2>Display Property </h2>
The display property is an important CSS property for controlling layout. It specifies whether an HTML element is treated as a block or an inline element.<br>
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline. The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements.
<pre>

1. block 
-> A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Examples of block-level elements:
div, h1 - h6, p, form, header, footer, section etc...

2. inline
-> An inline element DOES NOT start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
Examples of inline elements:
span, a, img etc....

3. inline - block
-> Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height, width, padding, and margin values

4. none
-> When using display: none; the element is completely hidden from the document flow and does not take up any space.

Note : <em> You can also use visibility:hidden; to hide an element. However, with this property, the element will be hidden, but it will still take up the same space as if it was visible:</em>
